# Power-Bi-Dashboard

Hello Everyone

Here I am presenting my Dashboard Using Power BI by using the Adventure works Data( Customers, Calender, categories, Sub-Cat, Products, returns, and territories) 

In this Dashboard, you will find out 
✅ The sum of Annual Income by Age Range, Family Size, Home Owner and Marital status
✅ Sum of Age by Occupation
✅ By using KPI I have shown the Average Annual Income, the Sum of Large Income, and the Average Age

I have used DAX(Data Analysis Expressions) to create calculated columns and measures.
